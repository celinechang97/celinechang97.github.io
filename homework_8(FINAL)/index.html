			<div class="sectionDescription">
				Ashtanga yoga is a method of yoga taught by the late Sri K. Pattabhi Jois in Mysore, India.  Also known as Guruji, Pattahbi Jois brought the Ashtanga Yoga method to westerners in the early 1970s.  Since then, the practice of Ashtanga Yoga, while still sparse in the United States compared to other methods (Vinyasa/Flow, Power, and Hot Yoga), has continued to gain popularity for it’s strong mental, spiritual, and physical benefits.  
				<br> <br>
				This form of yoga involves synchronizing the breath with a set series of postures in a vinyasa (“flow”) style.  Through breath and vinyasa, internal heat is produced, leading to cleansing, improved circulation, and allowing the body to become healthy, light, and strong.  In the Ashtanga Yoga method, each posture in each series is a preparation for the next posture, which helps the yoga student develop strength, flexibility, and balance of both the body and mind.

				Vinyasa
			</div>
			<div class="sectionDescription">
				Vinyasa is a style of yoga characterized by stringing postures together so that you move from one to another, seamlessly, using breath.  Commonly referred to as “flow” yoga, it is sometimes confused with “power yoga“.

				Vinyasa classes offer a variety of postures and no two classes are ever alike.  The opposite would be “fixed forms” such as Bikram Yoga, which features the same 26 postures in every class, or Ashtanga which has the same sequence every time.

				The variable nature of Vinyasa Yoga helps to develop a more balanced body as well as prevent repetitive motion injuries that can happen if you are always doing the same thing every day.

				As a philosophy, Vinyasa recognizes the temporary nature of things.  We enter into a posture, are there for a while and then leave.

				While Vinyasa, or Vinyasa-Krama, dates back to the Vedic age—the earliest period of yoga thousands of years ago—it referred to a series, or sequence of steps, to make something sacred.
